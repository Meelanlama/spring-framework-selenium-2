Java code and Html. Static part will be displayed in website using html.

<% Inside java %> - whatever code you write inside this script is rendered as java.

how jsp works? its converted into java class by tomcat and executes that class and converts into the servlet.
Servelts is generated when using jsp and kept in local temporary folder called work.

//JSP Page Directives
To include/embed another jsp file in jsp:
<% include file ="/index.jsp"%>

The basic difference between getAttribute() and getParameter() is that the first method extracts a (serialized) Java object and the other provides a String value.
Thats why we use getArttribute in session() as it returns objects.

// Retrieving value like servlet in jsp using request object.
<% String name = request.getParameter("name"); %>

request,session,application -> for request, session and context objects.

 session.setAttribute("sessionUserName",name);
 application.setAttribute("contextUserName",name);

In jsp we no need to define it, can just directly setAttribute.

//Now getting the attribute we set:
The username in the session object is: <%= session.getAttribute("sessionUserName") %>
<br>
The username in the application context object is: 
<%= application.getAttribute("contextUserName") %>

//Using jspInit and InitParams: default parameter same as servlets:

Creating servlet and mapping and giving init value in web.xml file.
