In our application, one last thing is pending..

Whenever, we are ordering the food from welcome page. We need to capture that data from page and show it in the processOrder page.

Capture the food data in controller and we need to keep inside the model and send it via model to next page/view and show via ${} in view.

// What happens when we click on Order(Submit) button?

1. It will redirect us to new url home.com/processOrder,
2. And sending that request/data to DISPATCHER SERVLET(/home.com/*) from the welcome page, front controller receives the request with data.
3. DISPATCHERSERVLET finds the /processOrder RequestMapping and invoke that method and gets executed so this method needs to capture that data passed by DISPATCHERSERVLET from the previous method.
4. Now, we handle and send the data from that method to next page Using DispatcherServlet. It passes data to view resolver finds that particular view and shows that data to the client.

 // This controller job is to display the food ordered from the welcome page..

    @RequestMapping("/processOrder")
    public String processOrder(HttpServletRequest request,Model model) {

	//First By Using (HTTPServletRequest request)
        //handling the data received from the user
        String food = request.getParameter("foodType"); //"foodType" is input name..

        //adding the captured value to the model
        model.addAttribute("userFood", food);

        //setting the user data with the model object and sending to view
        return "process-order";
    }


-- Getting from view

<p>Your order <span style="color: red;">${userFood}</span> is getting ready..</p>
