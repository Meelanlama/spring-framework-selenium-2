@Controller
public class SisController {

    @ResponseBody
    @RequestMapping("/makeup")

    public String giveMakeup(){
        return "Take this Makeup";
    }

    @ResponseBody
    @RequestMapping("/clean")
    public String cleaning(){
        return "Cleaning house...";
    }
}

We can create as many methods as we want, inside the controller.There's no limitation.
They can have multiple handler methods.


//We can also use @RequestMapping in the class level.

@Controller
@RequestMapping("/sis")
public class SisController {}


When mapping is in class then the mapping of class should be in url inorder to execute http://localhost:8080/MyMvc_war_exploded/home.com/sis/makeup
