@Controller
public class MomController {}
Now that class becomes controller.

Now we add  this tag in our frontcontroller xml body

    <context:component-scan base-package="controllers"/>
    <context:annotation-config/>


Now,when this tag scans the components of the class in that package and will place those objects/bean inside the spring container.

@Controller and @Component is same. And creates bean of mom and initialized inside the container.

Spring will automatically initializse the class having a @Controller annotation and register that class with the spring container.


//home.com/sugar

@Controller
public class MomController {

    @ResponseBody
    @RequestMapping("/sugar")
    public String giveSugar() {
        return "ok,take this sugar";
    }
}

@ResponseBody write the message in HTTP response.
@RequestMapping("/sugar") is home.com/sugar and that method will return to that browser

//home.com/football

@Controller
public class BroController {

    @ResponseBody
    @RequestMapping("/football")
    public String giveFootball(){
        return "Take this football";
    }
}
