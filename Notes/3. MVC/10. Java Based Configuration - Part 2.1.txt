Deploy our webapplication to Tomcat without WEB.XML.

1. Where we have our configured DispatcherServlet?
In WEB.XML FILE.

2. What is a WEB.XML File?
It's a deployment descriptor which is a config file for our web-app that will be automatically picked by our webserver like tomcat and read configuration.
-Here we define classes,resource and the configuration of application.

-The web server uses these information to serve a web request.
-When the web server recevies a web request, it uses the deployment descriptor's url mapping to send the request to a specific servlet which can handle that request. (Means, in web.xml dispatcher servlet is mapped with url eg: /home.com/*, tomcat will read this url mapping and whenever request is incoming to that certain url then it'll send that request to mapped servlet and handle that request.
-Our controllers are also servlet.

3. Who is reading the WEB.XML file?
Our webserver(tomcat) is reading it to fetch into configuration file of the developer.

4. What kind of configuration we can do in WEB.XML?
Configure servlet, url mappings, filters, security, error handling(like whenever error happens we can configure that error in page.)

5. What will happen if we Delete WEB.XML?
Your web project will still run without a probelm.

6. Can we deploy/run a web app without a web.xml file?
Yes, this file is optional from servlet 3.0 as it'll have a servlet container.

7.How can i configure important info about my web app?
By using Java Annotation

SPRING MVC JAVA BASED CONFIGURATION

1.How a class will automatically detected by tomcat(Servlet container) like web.xml
- WebApplicationInitializer gives it a superpower to detect it.
- call back method is called automatically

2. What is a servletContext(WebApplicationInitializer is also servletcontext)?
It's an interface, the servlet container gives the implementation for servlet context interface. 
The servlet container(Tomcat) is going to create servletContext object automatically.
The servletContext object is created one per web application.


class HiTomcatPleasePickMe implements WebApplicationInitializer{
@Override
void onStartup(ServletContext servletContext){
//create dispatcher servlet here
//register dispatcher servlet with servletContext

}
}

FYI: DispatcherServlet has it's own web application context.
