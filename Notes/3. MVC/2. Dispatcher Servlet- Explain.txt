The Dispatcher Servlet is a central component in the Spring MVC framework, acting as the front controller that coordinates the request-handling process in a Java web application. Here's a structured breakdown of its role and functionality:

Key Responsibilities:

1.Request Handling Entry Point:

- Receives all incoming HTTP requests (configured via URL patterns like / in web.xml or auto-configured in Spring Boot).
- Serves as the single entry point for the application, adhering to the front controller design pattern.

2. Delegation to Components:

- Handler Mapping: Determines which controller method should handle the request (e.g., based on URL, annotations like @RequestMapping).
- Handler Adapter: Executes the controller method (e.g., methods annotated with @GetMapping).
- View Resolution: Uses a ViewResolver to map logical view names (e.g., "home") to actual view templates (JSP, Thymeleaf).
- Model Processing: Passes model data from controllers to views for rendering.

3. Response Generation:

- For traditional MVC: Renders views (HTML) using resolved templates and model data.
- For REST APIs: Uses HttpMessageConverter to serialize data (e.g., JSON/XML) directly into the response body (bypassing views when using @RestController).

//Workflow Summary:

1.Request Received: Dispatcher Servlet intercepts the HTTP request.

2.Determine Handler: Uses HandlerMapping to find the appropriate controller method.

3.Execute Handler: HandlerAdapter invokes the controller method, which returns a ModelAndView or data (for REST).

4.Process Response:
-For views: Resolves the view name to a template via ViewResolver and renders it.
-For REST: Converts return values to HTTP response format (JSON/XML) using message converters.

5.Response Sent: Final output is returned to the client.

//Configuration:

- Traditional Setup: Defined in web.xml with URL mappings.

- Spring Boot: Auto-configured with default settings (e.g., mapped to /).

//Key Components It Manages:

-HandlerMapping: Maps requests to handlers (controllers).

-HandlerAdapter: Executes handlers (controller methods).

-ViewResolver: Resolves view names to templates.

-HandlerExceptionResolver: Handles exceptions during request processing.

-LocaleResolver: Manages internationalization.

//Example Flow:

User visits /products.

Dispatcher Servlet routes the request to a ProductController method via @GetMapping("/products").

Controller fetches data and returns a view name "product-list".

Dispatcher Servlet uses ViewResolver to locate product-list.jsp, renders it with model data, and returns HTML.

// Importance:
Centralizes Control: Simplifies request routing, reducing boilerplate code.

Modular and Extensible: Components like ViewResolver or HandlerMapping can be customized.

Supports Both MVC and REST: Flexible for web pages or APIs.

//
The @GetMapping annotation in Spring MVC is a shortcut that maps HTTP GET requests to a specific method in your controller class. In simple terms:

What It Does:
Links a URL path (like /hello) to a method in your controller.

When a user visits that URL in their browser (or sends a GET request), Spring runs the method you annotated with @GetMapping.

--
@GetMapping is equivalent to @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET) but shorter and clearer.
