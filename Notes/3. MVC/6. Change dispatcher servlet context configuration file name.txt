How can we change dispatcher servlet context configuration file name?

The frontController servlet name and the xml file in web-inf directory should be same.
Like: dad-frontController, dad-frontController-servlet.xml

if deploying in server the servlet xml file is not found or name is different then it won't execute.

// How to let DispatcherServlet know that we have changed the config file name??

Don't use default search, rather use this and search for this particular file:

<init-param>
            <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
            <param-value>/WEB-INF/dad-frontController-servlet.xml</param-value>
</init-param>

param-value: it'll search for that file if name is different then also it'll run.Give the xml location.

Use the <init-param> tag if xml name is different.
