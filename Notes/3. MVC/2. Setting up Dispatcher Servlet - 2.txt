Qsn.// When will dispatcher servlet object be initialized/created ?
Once we deploy the app inside the tomcat server.

 <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>

This above code runs the server on startup and the object is initialized.

When DispatcherServlet is initialized then you should have a file inside web-inf directory and the naming of that file should be:

"dispatcherservlet-name" followed by "-servlet.xml"

Ex: dad-frontController-servlet.xml

// create that same name xml servelt file in web-inf folder because it searches the samename as frontcontroller

// IMP

We have created that same name xml file because whenever dispatcher servlet is initialized because it will default look in web-inf folder with same name as dispatcherservlet/frontcontroller.
