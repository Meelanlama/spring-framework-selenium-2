// SETTING PREFIX AND SUFFIX USING JAVA

InternalResourceViewResolver viewResolver = new InternalResourceViewResolver();
viewResolver.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/view/");
viewResolver.setSuffix(".jsp");

// SETTING PREFIX AND SUFFIX USING SPRING

<bean id = "viewResolver" class = "InternalResourceViewResolver">
<property name = "prefix" value = "/WEB-INF/view/" />
<property name = "suffix" value = ".jsp" />
</bean>

Now, the physical address is constructed by the view resolver which is:

return NIKEFootball;

"/WEB-INF/view/NIKEFootball.jsp"

-- THE dispatcher servlet will get the location and give it back to client.

// Question:
So here is a question. Does your controller require code changes, If your project UI technology is getting changed? Replay yes or no to this comment with a valid explanation.

Ans: No, our controller doesn't require code changes as we should only give file name in the controller and in spring config file/dispatcher servlet XML file we should update the prefix and suffix the file is changed. Update prefix if location is changed and suffix for file extension.
